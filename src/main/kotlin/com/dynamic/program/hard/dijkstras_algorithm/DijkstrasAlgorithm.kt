/**
 * You're given an integer start and a list edges of pairs of integers.
 *
 * The list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. The
 * number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges,
 * where each index i in edges contains vertex
 * i's outbound edges, in no particular order. Each individual edge
 * is represented by an pair of two numbers,
 * [destination, distance], where the destination is a positive
 * integer denoting the destination vertex and the distance is a positive integer
 * representing the length of the edge (the distance from vertex
 * i to vertex destination). Note that these edges are
 * directed, meaning that you can only travel from a particular vertex to its
 * destinationâ€”not the other way around (unless the destination vertex itself has
 * an outbound edge to the original vertex).
 *
 * Write a function that computes the lengths of the shortest paths between
 * start and all of the other vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's
 * algorithm and returns them in an array. Each index i in the
 * output array should represent the length of the shortest path between
 * start and vertex i. If no path is found from
 * start to vertex i, then output[i] should be -1.
 *
 * Note that the graph represented by edges won't contain any
 * self-loops (vertices that have an outbound edge to themselves) and will only
 * have positively weighted edges (i.e., no negative distances).
 *
 * If you're unfamiliar with Dijkstra's algorithm, we recommend watching the
 * Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before
 * starting to code.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * start = 0
 * edges = [
 * [[1, 7]],
 * [[2, 6], [3, 20], [4, 3]],
 * [[3, 14]],
 * [[4, 2]],
 * [],
 * [],
 * ]
 *
 * Sample Output
 * [0, 7, 13, 27, 10, -1]
