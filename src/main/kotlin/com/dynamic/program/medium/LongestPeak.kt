/**
 * <div class="html">
<p>
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of
the longest peak in the array.
</p>
<p>
A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are <b>strictly</b>
increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which
point they become <b>strictly</b> decreasing. At least three integers are required to
form a peak.
</p>
<p>
For example, the integers <span>1, 4, 10, 2</span> form a peak, but the
integers <span>4, 0, 10</span> don't and neither do the integers
<span>1, 2, 2, 0</span>. Similarly, the integers <span>1, 2, 3</span> don't
form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the
<span>3</span>.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>6 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3</span>
